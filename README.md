# android-vcf-contacts-tool
Add contacts/backup contacts.vcf file, so you never lose your contacts again!
* Export and import your contacts using the default com.android.contacts application
* This script will append each new contact to the end of your contacts.vcf to whatever folder this app.py is ran in, or will create a new contacts.vcf if you don't have one in your folder already.
